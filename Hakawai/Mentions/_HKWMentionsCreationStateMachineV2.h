/*!
 This class represents a state machine that manages the creation of mentions. In this case, 'mentions creation' is
 defined as either an active state in which the editor text view's viewport is locked and a list of potential mentions
 is displayed, or a passive state where mentions creation is stalled but the user is still eligible to resume mentions
 creation. The state machine also manages making requests to the data source and displaying the chooser list. The state
 machine should inform the host when mentions creation is canceled or completed.
