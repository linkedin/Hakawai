 An enum describing the way the accessory view should be added to the parent view.

 and accessory view are 'siblings' in the view hierarchy. This mode is intended for use cases where the text view
 resides within some container that should also hold the accessory views.

 \c HKWAccessoryViewModeFreeFloating causes the accessory view to be attached to the 'top level' view, specified by the
 \c setTopLevelViewForAccessoryViewPositioning: method. If the top level view is not specified, the text view tries to
 figure out the top level view at the time the view is attached.

 Order the text view to enter the 'single line viewport mode', where the current line is fixed in a given position and
 scrolling is disabled. If the text view is already in this mode, this method does nothing.

 will cause problems.

                                to the text view; instead they will trigger special events (that the plug-in can respond to)
